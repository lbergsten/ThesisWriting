%\section{Results}
Thus far I have outlined all reconstruction-level inputs to our analysis including event selection, backgrounds and their estimation methods, and systematic uncertainties. Each of these components is critical to our final result. This section will focus on the methods used to extract the VBF $H\rightarrow WW^*$ cross-section measurement. 
\section{Statistical analysis}
\subsection{Likelihood functions}
This analysis rests on the estimation of a paramete, $\mu$, signal strength, which describes the statistical significance of our signal yield relative to its Standard Model prediction and, in this particular analysis, defines the signal cross-section and signal and background yields. 

We build a likelihood function, $\mathcal{L}(\mu,\Theta)$, where the signal strength $\mu$ is a parameter of interest (POI) and nuisance parameters (NPs) $\Theta=\Theta_a,\Theta_b,...$ represent all relevant uncertainties. None of these values are known a priori, so the likelihood is built to represent the probability of particular values for the POIs and NPs. The analysis uses a maximum likelihood estimator to find the inputs which maximize the likelihood, i.e. minimize the negative log of the likelihood. Here I will briefly outline how a likelihood function can incorporate regions of interest. This discussion uses Ref.~\cite{cranmer2015practical} as a guide. The Poisson distribution $\mathcal{P}(n|\lambda)$ describes the probability of $n$ events with a true unknown yield $\lambda$:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(n|\lambda)= \lambda^n\frac{e^{-\lambda}}{n!}.
\end{equation}
We can define a variable observable $x$ with probability density $f(x)$, hence with $n$ events the probability density of each is multiplied. The likelihood of $\lambda$ can now be written as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\lambda)=\mathcal{P}(n|\lambda)\prod_{\text{event}}^n f(x).
\end{equation}
Our likelihood also must take into account multiple regions (the signal region as well as the control regions) and these likelihoods are multiplied together with their own distinct Poisson distributions,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\lambda)=\prod_r^{\text{regions}}(\mathcal{P}(n_r|\lambda_r)\prod_{\text{event}}^n f(x)).
\end{equation}
Our statistical fit maximizes this likelihood function and so produces a yield $\lambda$ for each free parameter simultaneously. The $\lambda$ values represent predicted yields where $\lambda_{r,b} = \mu \lambda_{\text{sig}}+\lambda_{\text{bkg}}$. Maximizing the overall likelihood is made simpler by applying the natural logarithm, as the products between Poisson distributions become summations.  

Particle physics defines discovery with rigorous standards using hypothesis testing. In the fit, we consider both the null (background-only) hypothesis, in which $\mu=0$, and the alternative hypothesis, in which we consider both signal and background to be present. The probability that the null hypothesis is rejected (or that the signal is discovered) is defined using a $p$-value. The $p$-value can be converted to a number of Gaussian standard deviations. In high-energy physics a 3 $\sigma$ significance, $p$-value of $1.35 \times 10^{-3}$, is considered evidence, while a 5 $\sigma$ result, $p$-value $2.87\times10^{-7}$, is considered a discovery.

This analysis uses the HistFitter software compiled with RooStats, RooFit, and HistFactory to perform the likelihood maximization. We measure the signal VBF Higgs cross-section in the fiducial space defined by the signal region selection with a simultaneous fit to the signal and control regions. Each region has a different distribution used in the fit to maximize that discrimination of each respective sample against all other events. This fit includes as floating parameters the signal strength of seven different processes: $\mu_{VBF}$, $\mu_{TopWW}$, $\mu_{Z+jets}$, $\mu_{ggFSR}$, $\mu_{ggF1}$, $\mu_{ggF2}$, and $\mu_{ggF3}$. Each numbered ggF parameter is estimated in an orthogonal control region described in Chapter 6 while ggF SR is measured in the signal region with a targed discriminant to differentiate VBF and ggF events. Other backgrounds, mis-identified leptons, $V/\gamma$, $VH$, and $ttH$, are included as fixed parameters. 

The background treatment differs depending on the particular region and sample. For $Z+$jets, a designated control region is used and the yield in the signal region is found by including a transfer factor, which maps the yield in the $Z+$jets control region to that in the signal region. Transfer factors to extrapolate yields are derived by normalizing to MC simulation. For backgrounds estimated within the signal region (Top/$WW$) the transfer factor is used only to extrapolate into the control regions where the contribution enters and thus uncertainties associated with transfer factors are reduced. We use the predicted MC values for all backgrounds included as fixed parameters such as $V\gamma$, $VH$, and $ttH$. We use a data-driven method to estimate the mis-identified lepton background. 

Events in the $e\mu$ and $\mu e$ channels are combined in the analysis and the likelihood is defined as the product of the Poissonians over BDT output bins in the signal region multiplied by the product of Poissonians over discriminant distributions in the controls regions (ggF CRs, $Z+$jets CR and Top/WW CR- within the signal region). The likelihood can then be calculated 

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}(\mu) = \displaystyle\prod_{j=0}^{N_{\text{sig BDT bins}}} \mathcal{P} (n_{j}|\lambda_r) \times \displaystyle\prod_{k=1}^{N_{\text{CR-bins}}} P(n_{k}|\lambda_b) \\
\qquad = \displaystyle\prod_{j=0}^{N_{\text{sig BDT bins}}} \mathcal{P} (n_{j}|\mu_s \lambda_{sig,j} + \displaystyle\sum_{n}^{N_{\text{bkg}}}\mu_b^{n} \lambda_{bkg}^{nj}) \times \displaystyle\prod_{k=1}^{N_{\text{CR-bins}}} P(n_{k}|\mu_s \lambda_{sig,k} + \displaystyle\sum_{n}^{N_{\text{bkg}}}\mu_b^{n} \lambda_{bkg}^{nk}).
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The signal and background strengths are denoted $\mu$ and the yields $\lambda$. Sums over all $n$ backgrounds include $Z+$jets, top/$WW$, and ggF; the minor backgrounds and data-driven $W+$jets estimate are added to Poisson expectations as fixed parameters. 

The last important additions to this likelihood are nuisance parameters. These parameters $\Theta$ come in two general types: systematics which do not affect the shape of discriminating variables ("flat systematics") and those that do ("shape systematics"). Flat systematics are constrained with a unit Gaussian and their effects are measured for $\Theta=\pm1$. Shape systematics are constrained with a unit Gaussian as well though their effects are measured through $\nu_{\text{shape}}(\Theta)= 1+\epsilon\Theta$, where $\epsilon$ is determined by measuring $\nu_{\text{shape}}$ at $\Theta=\pm 1$. Adding nuisance parameters $\Theta$ our final likelihood can be written 
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}(\mu,\vec{\Theta}) = \displaystyle\prod_{j=0}^{N_{\text{sig BDT bins}}} \mathcal{P} (n_{j}|\mu_s \lambda_{sig,j} + \displaystyle\sum_{n}^{N_{\text{bkg}}}\mu_b^{n} \lambda_{bkg}^{nj}) \times \displaystyle\prod_{k=1}^{N_{\text{CR-bins}}} P(n_{k}|\mu_s \lambda_{sig,k} + \displaystyle\sum_{n}^{N_{\text{bkg}}}\mu_b^{n} \lambda_{bkg}^{nk})  \times
  \displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^{N_{\Theta_i}}G(\tilde{\Theta_i}|\Theta_i,1)
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $G(\tilde{\Theta_i}|\Theta_i,1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\frac{(\tilde{\Theta}-\Theta)^2}{2}}$ is the unit Gaussian and $\tilde{\Theta}$ is an auxiliary measurement of $\Theta$.

The fit is performed simultaneously for the signal region, three ggF control regions, a $Z+$jets control region, and a shared top/$WW$ control defined within the signal region. Table~\ref{tab:regiondefinitions} summarizes the regions used within the fit and their defining selections. These are discussed in more detail in Chapters 5 and 6.

Each of the regions included in the fit uses a different discriminant to best characterize that sample's contribution. These discriminants are almost all BDT outputs trained on various kinematic distributions to characterize certain background and signal samples, as discussed in Chapters 5 and 6. The $Z+$jets control region is defined with $m_T$ instead of a designated BDT after studies showed its success at mitigating uncertainty on $\mu_{Z+\text{jets}}$. These studies are included in Appendix B. Table~\ref{tab:fitinputs} summarizes the fit regions and shows their discriminant and number of bins. Table~\ref{tab:cryields} shows MC event yields in all regions included in the statistical analysis.

\subsection{Asimov results}
The Asimov dataset is formed with Monte Carlo pseudo-experiments and by design returns the true value for each estimated parameter. We use the Asimov dataset to test analysis strategies and deduce expected performance of the fit without using true data. We ``blind'' the data with by removing events in the uppermost bins of the BDT$_{\text{VBF}}$ and use only Monte Carlo events in the signal region to eliminate any potential bias. Using this approach, we gain an understanding for the constraints on our nuisance parameters and their expected uncertainties. Using the Asimov dataset, all floating parameters are measured to be 1 and all nuisance parameters 0. Results of the fitted nuisance parameters to the Asimov dataset are made under the hypothesis that VBF Higgs boson cross-sections follow our Standard Model predictions. 

Fit results for each of the signal strength parameters in our statistical fit are shown with statistical uncertainties only and statistical$+$systematic uncertainties. After including all uncertainties, the Asimov dataset provides an uncertainty $\pm22\%$ on $\mu_{VBF}$. This corresponds to a null p-value of $1.5\times10^{-9}$ or a signficance of 5.9$\sigma$, which is more than twice the expected significance in the last published ATLAS VBF Higgs $\rightarrow \ell\nu\ell\nu$ result ~\cite{Aaboud_2019}. Table~\ref{tab:muresults} shows the stat-only and combined systematic resulting signal strengths and their expected uncertainties based on Asimov fits.

\end{table}

We used the Asimov dataset to optimize fit strategies and selection criteria and to determine which uncertainies play large roles in this measurement. These include uncertainties related to jet flavor composition, which plays a large role in rejecting dominant top background events, and uncertainties on jet pile-up, which cause potential errors in the jet kinematics.

\subsection{Unblinded results}

After examining and testing Asimov results, we unblind the analysis, or incorporate observed data in the statistical analysis. For this thesis, this is done privately without ATLAS collaboration approval. \textcolor{red}{Does this need to be added?} Fit parameters measured by fitting simulated events with observed data are shown in Table~\ref{tab:datamuresults}.

Data (black) closely matches Standard Model simulations except for some individual bins where deviations are well within the level of expected uncertainty. Bars on data points account for statistical uncertainties and shaded area shows systematics on MC events.

Figure~\ref{fig:correlations} shows correlations between floating parameters in the fit using a stat-only scheme where only the seven floating signal strength parameters are included. This is to focus on the parameters which most impact the fit, although we also inspect correlations between our nuisance parameters. This is included in Ref. \cite{ourSupportNote}. Correlations between fit parameters would indicate potential instability in the overall result as small changes in some estimated parameters would severely impact others. The correlation between measured background and signal parameters is small, through some parameters like $\mu_{ggF1}$ and $\mu_{ggF3}$ are anti-correlated. We have further tested the robustness of these parameters by changing their binning and discriminants and concluding that our overall Asimov fit result remains stable.

We visualize our likelihood minimization in Figure~\ref{fig:scan}. We perform a one-dimensional scan of our parameter of interest $\mu_{\text{VBF}}$ using the inputs and distributions of of our fit. The figure shows fit results for $\mu_{\text{VBF}}$ if we use all systematics, only statistical uncertainties, and finally if we were to leave only $\mu_{\text{VBF}}$ as a floating parameter and all others constant. These results demonstrate the leading role statistical errors have in the determining our final fit value. The stat-only analysis has an expected uncertainty of $16.8/-16.2\%$ while including all systematics gives an expected $19.0/-19.3\%$. 

We can break down these impacts to assess which uncertainties (nuisance parameters) have the greatest effects on each measured parameter. In this way, we find any that seem unduly high and test statistical means to control their effects like altering the event selection and adjusting control region definitions. Figure~\ref{fig:impacts} shows the 30 largest impact parameters for the measured signal strength. These effects are derived post-fit which means that at the maximum of the likelihood each parameter is changed by $\pm 1\sigma$ individually. The measured effects of these changes are shown in blue on the plots and ranked in order of their total combined positive and negative impact.

Most of the uncertainties in Figure \ref{fig:impacts} are expected to have substantial impacts on the measurement. While ggF is not the largest uncertainty, its similar signature makes it particularly difficult to differentiate from our signal. The combined $WW$/top estimation has a similarly 
large effect on the measurement. Here the backgrounds are easily differentiated from the signal but outsize the signal by far even in the signal region. Jet-related experimental systematics have the largest effects of any, with impacts from jet energy resolution, jet pile up, and jet flavor tagging. This is expected because of the large range of jet kinematic variables in our multivariate analysis. Finally, theory systematics are pivotal to the overall estimation. VBF and ggF theory uncertainties are dominant---particularly VBF shower and PDF and ggF shower parameters. Chapter 5 describes the size of these variations and explains their role in the final measurement. All theoretical systematics in this analysis are estimated using floating global variations. This intentionally overestimates the uncertainties since the final analysis will contain shape systematics that are not accounted for with this method. One of the largest overestimates comes from the top generator theory parameter. Since this background is estimated within the signal region, it will be normalized to its yield in that region and only shape systematics will have an effect. Chapter 5 shows these shape variations are small thus we can expect that the top generator uncertainty will have a smaller effect when shape systematics are included. 

The fit results shown in this thesis demonstrate the most recent calculations and developments from the VBF $H\rightarrow WW$ fiducial cross-section measurement but they are not yet complete. Final fit parameters may continue to change before the analysis is published. 

\section{Fiducial and inclusive cross sections}
This analysis aims to measure the total VBF $H\rightarrow WW^*\rightarrow\ell\nu\ell\nu$ cross-section in both a particular fiducial region and in a more inclusive region. The analysis group also has the goal of measuring fiducial differential $H\rightarrow WW^*$ cross-sections over a range of kinematic variables, though these measurements are beyond the scope of this thesis. In each case, the measurement must be translated from one that only represents conditions in the ATLAS detector to values that can be understood with a broad range of theoretical models. For fiducial measurements, this can be done relatively simply with a $C$ factor. First, a fiducial region must be defined that is applicable to both reconstructed and purely theoretical, called truth level, events. This fiducial region defines the conditions under which the cross-section is measured. The fiducial cross-section is defined as
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\text{VBF}H\rightarrow WW^*\rightarrow\ell\nu\ell\nu}^{\text{fid}} = \frac{N_{\text{obs}}-N_{\text{bkg}}}{C\times\mathcal{L}},
\end{equation} 
where $\mathcal{L}$ is the integrated luminosity and $N$ (obs,bkg) is the observed and estimated background number of events, respectively. $N_{\text{bkg}}$ is calculated through the simultaneous fit with simulated and observed events. $C$ is a factor that accounts for detector effects that would lower the overall cross-section like detector inefficiences and resolution effects. The fiducial phase space is defined as close to the reconstruction-level signal region as possible to minimize theoretical extrapolation. Table~\ref{tab:fiducial} lists all fiducial cuts that describe the phase space. These include requirements on lepton number, flavor, sign, and kinematics, missing energy, jet number, as well as other VBF specific requirements (OLV and CJV cuts).

These cuts represent the space within which both reconstruction-level and truth-level cross-sections are measured. Yields are extracted from the statistical fit and a $C$-factor is defined, 
\begin{equation}
C = \frac{N_\text{fid}}{N_{\text{reco}}},
\end{equation}
where $N_\text{fid}$ is extacted from theoretical simulation. Powheg$+$Pythia8 are used to extract theoretical yields in the fiducial region. The truth-level cutflow is shown in Table~\ref{tab:truth}. There are $371.5\pm0.6$ truth level VBF Higgs events in the final fiducial region and thus $C=2.23\pm 0.40$.

Using this value for $C$ and a predicted cross-section value of 2.67$\pm 0.40$ fb, from the Powheg$+$Pythia8 fiducial cross-section truth estimate, we find a final cross-section measurement:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\text{fid,obs}} = 2.31 \pm 0.44 \text{fb} 
\end{equation}

This measured value closely matches our expected truth value, within one standard deviation, and its error of $19\%$ is well below the previous $50\%$ uncertainty measured on the $H\rightarrow WW^*$ VBF production cross section with 36.1 fb$^{-1}$~\cite{Aaboud_2019}. 
%This standard deviation corresponds to a 6$\sigma$ observation with $p= $. The VBF $H\rightarrow\ell\nu\ell\nu$ cross-section is observed with a 1/100000 chance of statistical anomaly.  

The inclusive cross-section requires one additional acceptance correction factor, $A$, which is estimated from theoretical calculations and extrapolates the fiducial cross section to a more inclusive phase space defined solely by a requirement for $N_{\text{jets}}\geq2$, where each jet has $p_T>30$GeV. This will be calculated from
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{VBF}^{\text{incl}} = \frac{\sigma_{VBF}^{\text{fid}}}{A}.
\end{equation}
The inclusive cross-section widens the applicable phase space of the measurement and provides another useful metric to compare data with expected Standard Model results. The $A$ factor is found through theoretical calculations which use Powheg to estimate VBF processes at next-to-leading order in QCD and inclusive cross-section calculations from the Yellow Report \cite{LHCCrossSectionWG}. The theoretical fiducial cross section is found to be $2.67\pm$ fb using the events in Table~\ref{tab:truth} and the inclusive VBF $H\rightarrow WW^*\rightarrow \ell\nu\ell\nu$ cross section is calculated at 85.8$\pm 17.6$ fb. The inclusive cross section can be calculated simply with the VBF $H$ cross-section derived for $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and $m_H=125$ GeV, and the branching fractions for $H\rightarrow WW^*$ and $WW^*\rightarrow\ell\nu\ell\nu$.  The acceptance factor is therefore measured to be $0.0312 \pm 0.006$. Using this factor we calculate an inclusive cross-section:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\text{incl,obs}} = 74.1 \pm 20.8 \text{fb}
\end{equation} 

This value again matches our expected Standard Model inclusive cross section within one standard deviation.  

\section{Differential cross-section measurements}
The differential cross-section measurement requires a more rigorous unfolding procedure than the total fiducial and inclusive cross-sections. Monte Carlo simulations processed in a pseudo-detector with all its expected inefficencies and limits (reconstruction-level) are compared to Monte Carlo simulations processed solely at the particle level (truth-level). The detector effects that influence reconstruction-level events are unfolded so that they match their truth-level counterparts. This reco-truth matching is a test that the unfolding process works as expected and does not bias results. This analysis employs the iterative bayesian unfolding method \cite{bayesian} whose goal is to determine the probability that each bin $j$ in a reconstruction-level distribution corresponds to bin $i$ in a truth-level distribution. Using Bayes' theorem, this probability can be attained with knowledge of the true spectrum $T$ and the measured or reco-level spectrum $R$. We begin with Bayes' theorem: 
\begin{equation}
P(T_i|R)=\frac{P(R,T_i)P(T_i)}{\sum_{t} P(R,T_t)P(T_t)},
\end{equation}
where the denominator is a normalization factor, $P(R,T_i)$ represents the likelihood and $P(T_i)$ the prior. The prior here is vague and so we begin with the assumption that $P(T_i)$ is constant. Hence the most probable spectrum for $T$ maximizes the likelihood. If we observe $n$ reco-level events, we can assign the probability of their true distributions through
\begin{equation}
\hat{n}(T_i)=n(R)\prod P(T_i|R).
\end{equation}
We then use resultant possibilities in the Bayes formula to evaluate $P(T_i|R_j)$. These values constitute the smearing matrix $M$. This matrix can then be used to estimate the truth-level events in each bin of a distribution with
\begin{equation}
\hat{n}(T_i)=\frac{1}{\epsilon_i}\sum_{j=1}^{n_R} n(R_j)\prod P(T_i|R_j),
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon$ is the inefficiency, or ratio of events that pass both truth and reco-level selection by those that pass only truth. Finally the truth can be determined by the reconstructed bin-by-bin yields through
\begin{equation}
n(T_i)=\sum_j M_{ij} \prod n(R_j).
\end{equation}
The migration matrix directly maps reco-level distributions to truth-level. In order to calculate this matrix iteratively we first allow $P(T_i)$ to be a constant distribution, say $1/n_T$, which gives an expected number of truth events $n_0(C_i)=P_0(C_i)\prod n_R$. Next, we calculate $\hat{n}(C)$ using the efficiency equation, and finally we use $\chi^2$ to compare $\hat{n}(C)$ and $n_0(C)$. In the next iteration, $n_0$ is replaced by $\hat{n}$ and $P_0$ by $\hat{P}$, $\hat{P(C_i)}=\hat{n}(C_i)/\hat{N_{true}}$, and the procedure continues until $\chi^2$ falls below a set threshold. 

While the final unfolding results fall beyond the scope of thesis, results for four kinematic variables are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:unfoldingmatrices}. We use reconstruction-level Monte Carlo events and their truth counterparts to calculate migration matrices for each differential observable through the iterative Bayesian unfolding process.

Further developments in unfolding are underway currently and include estimating error added by the procedure, testing for potential biases toward the truth distribution, and understanding unfolding reconstruction level uncertainties as well as nominal distributions. 

\section{Future results and measurements}

This thesis detailed the HWW VBF fiducial cross-section analysis as it currently stands, but there are further developments still underway. This analysis plans to measure differential cross-sections and the full unfolding procedure is almost complete. In addition, Chapter 6 discussed some theoretical uncertainties (VBF and ggF Higgs as well as top, WW, and $Z\rightarrow \tau\tau$) but these are currently estimated through global floating values. In the final analysis the uncertainties shape effects will be taken into account as well as their normalization variations.  

Signal and background yields will be used within the unfolding mechanism to extract final differential distributions. The variables used in the differential analysis will also be finalized in coming months. We aim to unfold 14 variables which are listed with their planned bin edges in Table~\ref{tab:observablebins}. These variables probe the kinematics of the final state particles measured through this channel and add sensitivity to the total fiducial and inclusive cross-sections. The invariant mass of the two jets that accompany the $W$ bosons ($m_{jj}$) and the angular separation between them ($\Delta y_{jj}$) are particularly sensitive to the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. Deviations between data and theoretical predictions in the distribution of these variables may be signs of new physics that alter the HWW coupling, like new resonances at high energy scales not accessible by direct searches.

This analysis uses the full Run 2 dataset for VBF HWW cross-sections and new statistical methods. These have led to expected results which demonstrate large increases in sensitivity with respect to the most recent measurements. The VBF differential cross-sections measured for $H\rightarrow WW^*\ell\nu\ell\nu$ will be the first analyzed with the ATLAS experiment. 

%This analysis has an additional motivation as well. It is the first step in a larger measurement of both the VBF HWW differential cross-section and the Standard Model VBF $W+jj$ production cross-section. In the $W+$ jets production in the $\ell+$jets final state, the invariant mass of the two jets that accompany the $W$ bosons and the rapidity separation between them are particularly sensitive to the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism just as in the VBF HWW cross-section. The final-state jets also have similar kinematics. Therefore the ratio of cross sections measurement allows for the cancellations of correlated systematic uncertainties. As both process are characterized by large ($10\%-20\%$) jet-related uncertainties, a reduction via the ratio cancellation would greatly improve the sensitivity to the VBF Higgs process and to the search for new phenomena in the context of EFT. This ratio measurement falls beyond the scope of this thesis but represents a complementary motivation to the measurements shown here. 

%In the context of vector boson scattering and with minimal assumptions on new physics, new phenomena are expected at a scale ($\Lambda$) higher than the one accessible by the experiment. These simultaneously effect $HWW$ and $WWV$ vertices. In particular, dimension-6 operators affect VBF Higgs mechanisms and VBF $W$ production, while the interplay of VBF and VBS mechanisms allows for the probe of dimension-6 and dimension-8 operators. The sensitivity to new physics is enhanced with precision-level measurements of fiducial and differential ratios of cross sections. Specifically, new phenomena that simultaneously affect both vertices are suppressed in the ratio of VBF Higgs to VBF $Wjj$ production, thus enhancing the sensitivity the phenomena affecting the $WWV$ vertex, for example. Similarly enhanced sensitivity can be achieved for anomalous quadruple-gauge couplings via the study of VBF Higgs and VBS $W$ productions. This ratio measurement between the two cross-sections is planned after publication of the VBF HWW differential cross-sections.
