This analysis studied the use of a multiclass BDT that differentiates between VBF Higgs, ggF Higgs, and SM WW backgrounds for the final statistical fit. This BDT showed success at differentiating VBF signal from WW backgrounds but found very little discrimination with ggF. Using the ABCD method and targetted ggF control regions and discriminants showed better overall signal significance in the final statistical fit. While this BDT was not used its optimization informed the choice of input variables and settings for the 1D BDTs ultimately chosen. 

The training strategy and inputs are discussed first followed by the results in terms of projected BDT outputs and expected significance. Finally, comparisons between ggF discrimination using alternative 1D BDTs are discussed. 

The boosted decision tree training algorithm used in the multiclass BDT training used the TMVA gradient boosting algorithm to discriminate between three classes of events. A collection of cuts is designed to classify events as WW-like, ggF-like, or VBF-like. After the initial tree is built another tree is grown to better separate the misclassified events. This proceeds iteratively until there is a collection of a specified number of trees (boosting). A weighted average is taken from all these trees to form a BDT output discriminant with values ranging from 0 to 1.

The multiclass BDT is trained using $e\mu+\mu e$ events after the VBF pre-selection and the signal regions cuts including that on $n_{jets}$, $b$-veto, OLV, CJV, $M_{jj}$ and $DY_{jj}$, as well as a cut on the $\Ztt$ BDT (described in Appendix E). The phase space in which we train the BDT is exactly the same as the one where we apply it. The training includes the $WW$ background, $ggF$ background and the VBF signal, each defined in Section~\ref{sec:MCSamples}. The MC statistics used in the training are half those available after all signal region cuts (the other half are needed for training). This corresponds to $\approx$ 500,000 $WW$ events, $\approx$ 20,000 $ggF$, and $\approx$100,000 VBF events.

The TMVA BDTG interface is used to train and test the multiclass BDT. The optimal parameters were found through a scan of reasonable values and the final set is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:multiBDTparameters}.

For this BDT, variables were carefully chosen to optimize in differences in distributions between each the three classifications. Over 25 postentially useful variables were used in the multiclass BDT and the most impactful of these were chosen. Training variables for the optimal analysis include $M_{l1j1}$, $M_{l1j0}$, $M_{l0j1}$, $M_{l0j0}$, $\sum \eta_\ell^{\mathrm{centrality}}$, $\Delta \phi_{jj}$, $p_T^{j0}$, $p_T^{j1}$, $p_T^{j2}$, $\eta^{j0}$, $\eta^{j1}$, $\eta^{l0}$, $\eta^{l1}$, $p_T^{l0}$, $p_T^{l1}$, $p_T^{\text{tot}}$, $\Delta \eta_{jj}$, $\sum \eta_{jj}$, $m_T$, $m_{ll}$, $\Delta phi_{\ell\ell}$, $\Delta Y_{\ell\ell}$, $\sum M_{lj}$, and $\Delta Y_{jj}$. Plots below show the input distributions of each variable used to train the multiclass BDT \ref{fig:multiclassBDTinput} and the correlatiosn between these variables \ref{fig:multiclasscorrSB}.

BDT input variables are ranked by importance through a TMVA algorithm. The algorithm determines how often the each variable is used to split decision tree nodes and then weights each split by the separation gain-squared achieved and by number of events in that node \ref{TMVA user guide}. Ranking results are displayed in order of variable importance \ref{tab:rankingmulti}.

The BDT training separates the three signals it trains upon. In order to quantify the discrimination we use the integrated-ROC calculated through TMVA for unweighted normalized samples and find an optimal value of 0.939 (VBF), 0.804 (ggF), and 0.947 (WW). Comparisons between the test and training show that the BDT is un-biased- differences between testing and training samples would imply overtraining, or the BDT using to many parameters on too few events. Visually, one can see that the testing and trainings samples are quite similar. The BDT output variable is visualized both on un-weighted normalized samples and on samples with all event weights applied. The plots \ref{fig:multiclassBDTresult} show BDT results applied to un-weighted and weighted samples of VBF, ggF, and WW. The weighted plots shown also include all other backgrounds included in our analysis in order to understand how the entire dataset distributes with this BDT training. Since our BDT is trained in three dimensions, the plots in \ref{fig:multiclassBDTresult} are projections onto each axis. We can similarly visualize the results in three dimensions to understand correlations between the sample outputs shown in \ref{fig:multiclass3D}.

A Gaussian quantile transformation is applied to each of the multiclass BDT output distributions. Using the Root function \textit{Cephes::ndtri}, or the inverse of a normal distribution, new distributions spread such that the area under the probability density function from $-\inf$ to each transformed value $x = ndtri(y)$ is equal to the original value $y$. Using these transformations has led to increased significance over the distributions as shown in \ref{fig:multiclassBDTresulttrans}.

Two last key metrics for testing the success of our multiclass BDT are S/B and signal significance examined both bin-by-bin and summed over the entire distribution. Figure \ref{fig:multiclass3D} shows the distribution of the first VBF signal across all BDT variables in 3D. Additional plots showing correlations between VBF/ggF/WW BDT outputs and input variables are shown in Appendix G. The first plot shows all backgrounds combined and so the overall background distribution over all multiclass BDT variables. The bottom-left plot shows signal significance defined as $s/\sqrt{s+b}$ and the rightmost plot shows $s/b$. The overall expected significance can be calculated by adding simple signicance bin-by-bin in quadrature to obtain the value of 7.6. For a more accurate value, the following significance definition is summed in quadrature:
\[
    Z = 
\begin{cases}
    +\sqrt{2(n\ln[\frac{n(b+\sigma^2)}{b^2+n\sigma^2}]-\frac{b^2}{\sigma^2}\ln[1+\frac{\sigma^2(n-b)}{b(b+\sigma^2)}])},& \text{if } n\geq b\\
    -\sqrt{2(n\ln[\frac{n(b+\sigma^2)}{b^2+n\sigma^2}]-\frac{b^2}{\sigma^2}\ln[1+\frac{\sigma^2(n-b)}{b(b+\sigma^2)}])},& \text{if } n<b .
\end{cases}
\] 
where $b$ denotes background estimates with an statistical uncertainty $\sigma$ and $Z$ represents significance of seeing $n$ signal events. This definition of signal signicance is the current recommendation from the ATLAS statistics committee \ref{Buttinger:2643488}. Adding this definition of signal signifiance bin-by-bin quadratically gives an overall value of 10.3.

\end{figure}

There are similar calculations simple significance and $Z$ using three 1D BDTs trained and used in the current analysis. While these are trained independently and so do not take into account correlations between BDT outputs, the overall discrimination is greater. These BDTs are detailed in the main text and consist of: VBF vs. ggF, VBF vs. top$+WW$, and top$+WW$ vs. all samples. These do not correspond directly to the 3D BDT (and are combined in the final analysis with additional discrimants for ggF) but can clearly show high discrimination in plots \ref{fig:1Das3D} without the need for additional transformations. The simple significance combined in quadrature is $8.9$ and the $Z$ is calculated at $10.1$. These are very similar to the values shown from the 3D BDT training and combined with the ABCD method employed to further reduce ggF background, provide better overall discrimination.

\end{figure}

Both methods leave our additional contributions from fake and $ttH$ backgrounds and both use the same cuts on the $\Ztt$ BDT for best comparison, though is not used in the final method. The binning in both cases is slightly different to optimize discrimination in each case.
